                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for learning and cultivating new skills. Currently I am proud to be working to develop a community promoting tech literacy and entry-level tech career employability in underserved areas of Eastern Kentucky with Code:You as a Regional Community Coordinator. My professional background is in mental/behavioral health treatment in both inpatient and outpatient settings, and most recently I worked with marginalized populations experiencing Substance Use Disorder.
                    I always aim to utilize my written and verbal communication skills, creative interests, passion for learning, and pride myself on my ability to maintain performance and professionalism in difficult / past-paced environments.

                    <h3>University of Kentucky HEALing Communities Study, 2023</h3>
                    <p>
                         While working at Spero Health, I had the opportunity to participate in the largest research grant ever received by the University of Kentucky designed to minimize risk of opiate overdose deaths by assisting researchers with development of information and resources to educate, guide change in perception and policy, and advocate for OUD-affected individuals and their families. During my work with the study, I assisted with data collection, interpretation, and reporting as well as implementation of solutions driven by data results.
